# My Portfolio

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
I have created this site to advertise my skills as a developer to potential employers.

## contributions:

### GitHub contribution history chart:

After a short search online I came accross an artical at <a href="https://thequickblog.com/how-to-embed-github-contribution-on-your-webpage/" target="_blank">The Quick Blog </a> by Sanjog SIgdel. In this artical he talks about a GitHub chart API made by Rushi Shah. You can find the API at <a href="https://github.com/2016rshah/githubchart-api" traget="_blank">Github Chart API</a>.

### using images in an array:

To give my projects in the list i have created to contain the details for the projects i have had to find a way to import specific images when a new project is added to the list. At first i could not figure this out until i found a answer on <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44607396/importing-multiple-files-in-react">Slack voerflow</a>. By following the answer given by Stephen Lee i was able to use his method in order to give each project im my list a picture.
